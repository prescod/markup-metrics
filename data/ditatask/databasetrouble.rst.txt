Troubleshooting a database
==========================

Databases rarely have problems, but this may be helpful if you find
some.

-  If performance is slow, try removing several thousand records.
-  If none of your commands work, make sure they are SQL commands and
   not SEQUEL commands.
-  If you cannot get anything to work at all, try uninstalling and
   reinstalling.
-  For more detailed troubleshooting help, see the online documentation
   shipped with your database.
