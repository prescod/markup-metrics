#@ Maintaining a Web Server #@


Maintaining a web server is really quite easy.

		
* If the web server crashes, restart it.
* Limit the number of connections to your server.
This will make it run faster.
* Make sure you do not put confidential material on your server.
It should be kept in a separate folder named "Private."
