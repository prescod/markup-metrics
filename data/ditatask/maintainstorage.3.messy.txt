#@ Maintaining your hard drive #@


Here are a few tips for maintaining your hard drive.
	
There is really not much to do to maintain a hard drive. However, if you want to keep it running for the
 next 10 years or so, you should follow these suggestions.
* If your drive has a low-power mode, make sure this comes on when your drive is sitting idle.
It will not get worn out as quickly if it is not needlessly spinning.
* Every once in a while, shake your computer.
This will cause the bits to fall more comfortably in to place.
* Run Scandisk on the drive at least once a day.
This way you will ensure that problems with the drive are found quickly. If you share the drive with
 others, it will also ensure that they are less likely to use it, because it will be so busy all of the
 time.
