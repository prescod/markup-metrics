# Troublshooting Web Server problems #


There are several things to try if your Web Server is not functioning properly.
	
- If others cannot connect to your server, try turning off their firewalls.
- If your server is running slowly, try limiting it to 2 or 3 connections.
- If your server keeps creating pop-up ads when people access it, please turn them off and things will run
 faster.
- If these directions are not helpful, please contact your service representative.
